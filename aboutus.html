Hetauda sub-metropolitan city is situated in the confluence of the two prominent national highways viz. Tribhuvan highway and Mahendra highway. It was declared a municipality in 1969 A.D (2026 B.S), but development was sluggish. Momentum increased when the city became headquarters of the Makwanpur district in 1982A.D (2039 B.S). It is regarded as a "Green city" because the city has planted trees on either sides of the road.</p> <br>

Hetauda is located at a distance of 76 km from the capital city, Kathmandu, via the fast track, at a distance of 132 km via Daman, Tribhuvan Highway and 224 km via Narayangadh.

Also, the first road tunnel is being constructed which is believed to shorten the distance between Hetauda and Kathmandu. It is expected that traveling time from Kathmandu to Hetauda via the road tunnel will be just 57 min and 13 sec only. </p> <br>
